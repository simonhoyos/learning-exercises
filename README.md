# Learning & Experiments

Welcome to my sandbox repo!

This is where I explore, test, and learn. From small code snippets to bigger experimental projects.
Think of it as a digital lab notebook: messy at times, but always about growth and discovery.

## Purpose
- Experiment with new programming languages, frameworks, and libraries
- Document learnings through mini-projects and prototypes
- Provide a reference space for future projects and ideas

## How to Use

1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/learning-experiments.git
   ```

Explore folders/projects of interest

Run experiments locally (instructions vary by file/folder)

## Contributions

This repo is primarily for personal learning, but feel free to fork it or suggest ideas!
Collaboration is always welcome in the spirit of shared learning.
